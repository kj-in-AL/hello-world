Have been learning to use Subversion in my current position, and when GitHub came up in a online course I was taking on Python/Data Science, I thought it might be interesting to see how GH compares to svn.

We currently have a lot of modified versions of the same basic SQL scripts in my team's svn directories, and I was curious if the branches might provide a better way to retain the changes associated with specific requests, but allow for a non-name specific way to relate the changes to the original script.  This way if a change needs to be made to the main version - we might be able to merge to the master, but otherwise just allow for the others to exist.
